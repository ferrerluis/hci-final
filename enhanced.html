                        <b>Increasing User Experience during visits through
                        augmented reality.</b>

                    <p>
                        Exhibits will be "alive." Each one of them will
                        narrate their stories verbally. Users approaching
                        a specific exhibit will be automatically contacted
                        by the exhibit. Using audio processing, simple
                        Natural Language Text Processing (NLTP), and 
                        machine learning, the exhibits will be able to
                        understand visitors and answer their questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This method will also track the paths that visitors
                        follow, which will allow for deep data analysis on
                        the popularity of exhibits and the paths that feel
                        more "natural" for visitors to go to next.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To complement this immersive environment, guards and
                        museum staff could dress according to the historic
                        time of the exhibition they are assigned to.

                    <h3>Execution</h3>
                    <p>
                        <b>
                            Supplying visitors with bluetooth bracelets
                            to track their movements around the exhibits
                            and to deliver an Augmented Reality experience.
                        </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When visitors enter the establishment, they will
                        be supplied with the bracelets. Small bluetooth
                        devices at every exhibition would recognize the
                        bracelet signals and activate the Artificial
                        Intelligence (AI) exhibit, which is equipped with
                        a set of speakers. The exhibit then would
                        start a conversation with the visitor(s). If
                        interested, the visitor(s) can reply back and hear
                        the full story from the exhibit. After hearing the
                        story, they can also ask the exhibit more questions
                        about its story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The device connected to the exhibit will send
                        the bracelet's tag and position to a
                        central computer in the museum that will gather and
                        process all the data for future analysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Data gathered can be used to rank the popularity
                        of the exhibits based on the attention that they get,
                        which would allow for an easier decision making process
                        when determining the continuation of an exhibit in the
                        museum.

                        <li>
                            <b>Cost.</b> Although bluetooth devices are
                            relatively cheap, installing them on each exhibit
                            can be costly at a large scale
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Lack of Space.</b> Bluetooth devices are not
                            very accurate, so exhibits would require an
                            increased separating space in order to function
                            properly 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Accessibility.</b> Visitors with hearing
                            disabilities would miss on the experience
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Participation.</b> Because of the human
                            nature of all the exhibits, they would not
                            be able to handle big crowds of people. That
                            is, they cannot respond to more than one
                            question at the same time
